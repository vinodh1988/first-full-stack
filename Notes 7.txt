     Browser -makes request
	 
	 Server side code - produces response
	 
	 
	 but how request reaches server and gets processed by server side code????
	 
	 
	    Server side executes and produce response that is understandable by the browser
		
		for example
		
		asp.net upon execution in server produces html,css and js   -- iis
		
		php upon execution responds with html ,css and js  - apache
		
		servlet and jsp upon execution responds with html,css and js  - tomcat,jboss
		
		
		http://hostname:port/resource

	Microservice Architecture
	
	
	 we dont deploy our application in web/application servers
	 
	 the code is not dependent on any external software
	 
	 the app/service is stand alone [it runs of its own and process requests of its own]
